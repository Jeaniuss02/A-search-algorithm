# A-search-algorithm
There are two grids represent two problem environments where an agent is trying to find a path from the start location (S) to the goal location (G). The agent can move to an adjacent square provided the square is white or grey. The agent cannot move to a black square which represents a wall. No diagonal movement is allowed. Moving into a white square has a cost of 1. Moving into a grey square has a cost of 3.
Implement a solution to the grid problem using A* search.
